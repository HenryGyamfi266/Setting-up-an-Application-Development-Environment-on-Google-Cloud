# Setting-up-an-Application-Development-Environment-on-Google-Cloud
In this project, I work on how and ways to set up environment for  applications.

## Overview
This project focuses on setting up a comprehensive environment for application development using Google Cloud services. It includes a step-by-step approach to configuring and utilizing Cloud Pub/Sub, Cloud Storage, and Cloud Run, which are foundational for building modern, scalable, and event-driven applications. Cloud Pub/Sub provides reliable, asynchronous messaging, while Cloud Storage offers secure, worldwide data storage. Cloud Run supports serverless, event-driven functions that handle HTTP requests and cloud events. By leveraging these services, the project aims to demonstrate best practices for application deployment, scalability, data management, and automation on Google Cloud.

### Key highlights of the project include:
Implementing secure communication between services using IAM roles and permissions.
Understanding data retention policies and message delivery guarantees in Pub/Sub.
Exploring various storage classes in Cloud Storage for cost-effective data management.
Using Cloud Runâ€™s auto-scaling capabilities to handle varying traffic loads without manual intervention.
Employing monitoring tools like Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring for effective troubleshooting and performance analysis.

## Objectives
Develop and Manage Pub/Sub Services: Configure Pub/Sub topics and subscriptions using the Python client library, and implement IAM policies for secure access management.
Design and Optimize Cloud Storage: Create Cloud Storage buckets with appropriate storage classes, implement versioning, and set up lifecycle policies for cost-effective data management.
Build and Deploy Cloud Run Functions: Develop, containerize, and deploy Cloud Run functions using Python, integrating event-driven triggers for scalable, serverless application deployment.
Automate Cloud Resource Management: Utilize Terraform or Google Cloud Deployment Manager to automate the setup of Pub/Sub, Cloud Storage, and Cloud Run services.
Integrate and Test End-to-End Workflows: Create a pipeline connecting Pub/Sub, Cloud Storage, and Cloud Run to process events and handle data asynchronously.
Monitor, Secure, and Optimize Services: Implement logging, monitoring, and alerting using Cloud Logging and Monitoring, and secure services with IAM policies and Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP).
